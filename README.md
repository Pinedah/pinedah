### Hi, I'm Francisco Pineda! 👋

Passionate Data Science student currently in my second year of college. My journey in the world of data, mathematics, and technology just begins! 
<!--I believe in the transformative power of technology and its ability to make a profound impact on our world.
I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and improve my skills, both as a data scientist/developer and as a person. 
I love diving into data, uncovering insights, and applying my findings to solve real-world problems.

I love Mathematics 💖, it has always been a passion of mine, and it plays a crucial role in my work and studies. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that science and technology offers and enjoy exploring new tools everyday! 

Beyond my academic pursuits: I'm a big fan of 🌟 Anime; I also love immersing myself in different worlds through 📖 Reading; ⚽ Sports keep me active and engaged; 🎶 Music is a constant companion, providing the perfect soundtrack for my studies and projects.<br>
I'm always open to learning new things and connecting with like-minded individuals. 😼
