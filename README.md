Hi, I'm Francisco Pineda! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Francisco Pineda, a passionate Data Science student currently in my second year of college. My journey in the world of data, mathematics, and technology fuels my drive to learn and innovate every day. I believe in the transformative power of technology and its ability to make a profound impact on our world.

I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and improve my skills, both as a data scientist/developer and as a person. I love diving into data, uncovering insights, and applying my findings to solve real-world problems. Mathematics has always been a passion of mine, and it plays a crucial role in my work and studies. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers and enjoy exploring new tools and frameworks. As a dedicated student at IPN | ESCOM, I continuously strive for academic excellence.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm a big fan of ðŸŒŸ anime, finding inspiration and creativity in the stories and characters. I also love immersing myself in different worlds through ðŸ“– reading, whether it's fiction or non-fiction. âš½ Sports keep me active and engaged, whether I'm playing or watching. ðŸŽ¶ Music is a constant companion, providing the perfect soundtrack for my studies and projects.

I'm always open to learning new things and connecting with like-minded individuals. Let's collaborate and grow together in this exciting journey of data science and technology!
